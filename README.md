# Dijkstra
A project I worked on for a data structures class.
We used a graph as a map and then used dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path for different scenarios.

* This project allowed me to better understand algorithms and how they're implemented as well as using Windowbuilder to create and modify a GUI.
